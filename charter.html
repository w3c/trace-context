    <p class="mission">The
      <strong>mission</strong> of the
      <a href="">Distributed Tracing Working Group</a> is to define standards for interoperability between tracing tools. Interoperability
      refers to:
      <ul>
        <li>A standardized way to propagate vendor specific tracing information across tiers instrumented with different tracing
          tools </li>
        <li>A standardized and extensible format to share trace data - full traces or fragments of traces - across tools for
          further interpretation </li>
      </ul>

        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>
          Modern cloud-native applications are highly distributed and often span multiple technology and vendor boundaries. The complexity
          of these applications requires a detailed understanding of how individual requests are executed. This is referred
          to as "tracing".
        </p>
        <p>
          Tracing tools for collecting this information have been available for quite some time. However, these tools have not been
          built with interoperability in mind. This leaves the developer with a number of challenges in getting an end-to-end
          trace of complex transactions:
          <ul>
            <li>Traces are often broken, because trace context information is lost in a contributing tier or the trace is restarted</li>
            <li>Vendors cannot pass proprietary information across tiers instrumented with a different implementation and therefore
              lose relevant information (e.g. step count, server information, ...)</li>
            <li> End users don't have the ability to create complete end-to-end traces of application transactions which are monitored
              by different tools, as there is no defined data format and semantics for trace data</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          The scope of this working group is the definition of data formats and headers enabling the propagation and correlation of
          tracing data across different implementations.

          To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 6 or more active participants for its duration, including representatives
          from the key implementors of this specification, and active Editors and Test Leads for each specification. The
          Chairs, specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute half of a working day per week towards
          the (Working|Interest) Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as described in

          This group primarily conducts its technical work

          The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and
          members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion.

        <h2>
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/Process-20170301/#Consensus">
            W3C Process Document (section 3.3</a>). Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal,
          which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little
          formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
          However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress, but consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the
          range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote, and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken
          in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional. A call for consensus (CfC) will be
          issued for all resolutions (for example, via email and/or web-based survey), with a response period from one week
          to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue. If no objections are
          raised on the mailing list by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus
          as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
