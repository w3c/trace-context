            A distributed trace is a set of events, triggered as a result
            of a single logical operation, consolidated across various
            components of an application. A distributed traces contains
            events that cross process, network and security boundaries.
            A distributed trace may be initiated when someone presses a
            button to start an action on a website - in this example, the
            trace will represent calls made between the downstream services
            that handled the chain of requests initiated by this button
            being pressed.
