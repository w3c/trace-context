# Processing Model

This section provides a step-by-step exemplary description of the behavior of a tracing
implementation - also called tracer - when a request is received, processed and 
potentially forwarded. This description can be used as a reference when
implementing a Trace Context compliant tracing system, middleware - like a proxy
or messaging bus - or cloud service.

## Processing Model for Working with Trace Context

The processing model describes the behavior of a tracer which modifies and
forwards Trace Context headers.

1. The tracer checks an incoming request for a `traceparent` and a `tracestate`
   header.
2. If no `traceparent` header is received, the tracer creates a new `trace-id`
   and `parent-id` representing the current operation.
3. If `traceparent` header is present, the tracer tries to parse the version of
   the `traceparent` header.
   - If the version cannot be parsed, the tracer creates a new
     `traceparent` header and deletes `tracestate`.
   - If the version number is higher than supported by the tracer, the
     implementation uses the format defined in this specification to parse
     `trace-id` and `parent-id`. The tracer will only parse `trace-flags` values
     supported by the current version of this specification and ignore all other
     values. If parsing fails, the tracing system creates a new `traceparent`
     header and deletes the `tracestate`.
4. If the tracer supports the version number, it validates `trace-id` and
   `parent-id`.
   - If either `trace-id`, `parent-id` or `trace-flags` are invalid, the tracer
     creates a new `traceparent` header and deletes `tracestate`.
5. The tracer validates the `tracestate` header. If the `tracestate` header
   cannot be parsed the tracer deletes it.
6. For each outgoing request the tracer performs the following steps:
  - The tracing system MUST modify the `traceparent` header.
    - **Update `parent-id`**. The value of property `parent-id` MUST be set to a
       value representing the ID of the current operation.
    - **Update `recorded`**. The value of `recorded` reflects the caller's
      recording behavior. The value of the `recorded` flag of `trace-flags` MAY
      be set to `1` if the trace data is likely to be recorded or to `0`
      otherwise. Setting the flag is no guarantee that the trace will be
      recorded but increases the likeliness of end-to-end recorded traces.
  - The tracer MAY modify the `tracestate` header
     - **Update key value**. The value of any key can be updated. Modified keys
        MUST be moved to the beginning of the list.
     - **Add new key-value pair**. The new key-value pair should be added into
       the beginning of the list.
     - **Delete the key-value pair**. Any key-value pair MAY be deleted. It is
       highly discouraged to delete keys that weren't generated by the same
       tracing system or platform. Deletion of an unknown key-value pair will
       break correlation in other systems. This mutation enables two scenarios:
       - Proxies can block specific `tracestate` keys for privacy and security
         concerns. - Truncation of long `tracestate` entries.
  - The tracer sets the `traceparent` and `tracestate` header for the outgoing
    request

## Alternative Processing

The processing model above describes the complete set of steps for processing
Trace Context headers. There are, however, situations when an implementation
might only support a subset of the steps described above. Proxies or messaging
middleware MAY decide to not modify the `traceparent` headers but remove invalid
headers or add additional information to `tracestate`.
