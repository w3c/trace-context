This is the First Public Working Draft
([FPWD](https://www.w3.org/2017/Process-20170301/#working-draft)). There are a
few implementations of this protocol available. Experimental interoperability
scenarios were run and have demonstrated promising results. The specification will be
progressed into Candidate Recommendation stage after that, drafts for binary, AMQP and
MQTT protocols will be written to make sure the concepts and structure defined
in this specification can be ported to other protocols.
